## üìù Description

The **Full-Stack Development Roadmap** is an interactive and detailed guide to help you track your progress as you learn full-stack development. It includes **granular sub-steps** for each phase of learning, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Laravel, and more. Each step has a **checkbox** to mark your progress, and the roadmap dynamically updates **progress bars** for individual phases and overall completion.

This project is perfect for beginners and intermediate learners who want a structured and visual way to track their full-stack development journey.
